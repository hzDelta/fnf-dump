# welcome to the dump
uhh yeah this is gonna be where i dump my fnf stuff (scrapped tracks, early tracks, art, images for embedding elsewhere...)

---

future additions(?):

`audio` folder
- the *"OST"* versions of tracks
  - basically the FLACs that get put up on streaming services
- FLPs for tracks/songs
  - very rare chance i actually do this considering GitHub's upload size limit
 
`images` folder
- [IPV](https://fileinfo.com/extension/ipv)s for art/assets
