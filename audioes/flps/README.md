# FL Studio Project Files (FLPs)

Most, if not all FLPs require `Version 24.2.2.4597` or newer.

[Download / Buy FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download)*

Required VST(i)s, plugins, and SoundFonts will be in each of the folders' `README.md` files.

<sup><sub>Consider supporting me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hzdelta) by buying an FLP or two, or just throw a couple bucks for the hell of it. Anything helps!</sub></sup>

<sup><sub>\* - Or just pirate it... Not telling you how to, I have my own license.</sub></sup>
