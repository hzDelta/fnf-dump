# FL Studio Project Files (FLPs)

All FLPs will have their dependencies in their individual `README` files. (Program versions, VST(i)s, Effects, SoundFonts, etc.)

<sup><sub>Consider supporting me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hzdelta) by buying an FLP or two, or just throw a couple bucks for the hell of it. Anything helps!</sub></sup>

<sup><sub>\* - Or just pirate it... Not telling you how to, I have my own license.</sub></sup>
