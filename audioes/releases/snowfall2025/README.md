# SNOWFALL
*Released 07-02-2025*

## Artist's Commentary

- I don't have much to say about this really. SNOWFALL started out as [Snowfall (Pico Mix)](https://youtu.be/KXKo5qlDTxs) but I quickly dropped it because everything was in swing tempo, including the vocals. Come a year later, when I was getting footage the 'the demsong motif' video, I realized how good SNOWFALL sounded and decided to release it on its own on my 18th birthday.
